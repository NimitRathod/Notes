If you are at the root of your working directory, you can do 
	git checkout -- . 
to check-out all files in the current HEAD and replace your local files.

You can also do git reset --hard to reset your working directory and replace all changes (including the index).

As per the Git Documentation git clean

Remove untracked files from the working tree

Step 1 is to show what will be deleted by using the -n option:

git clean -n

Clean Step - beware: this will delete files:

git clean -f

(
To remove directories, run git clean -f -d or git clean -fd
To remove ignored files, run git clean -f -X or git clean -fX
To remove ignored and non-ignored files, run git clean -f -x or git clean -fx
Note the case difference on the X for the two latter commands.

If clean.requireForce is set to "true" (the default) in your configuration, one needs to specify -f otherwise nothing will actually happen.

Again see the git-clean docs for more information.
